No semicolons, defining different methods (Ruby is class based, so there are more methods than functions in this instance), etc. I spent a whole month stuck on what this method did: build_string = base_html . gsub ( \"{{ head }}\" , \" #{ page_partial } \" ) . gsub ( \"{{ seo }}\" , seo_html ) . gsub ( \"{{ main }}\" , main_css ) . gsub ( \"{{ dev }}\" , dev_html ) I figured out it was just generating strings in the files I passed to the .gsub method.
